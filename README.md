# ReliableDataTransfer
Team Assignment for Computer Networking
This assignment expected us to implement a Reliable Data Transfer Protocol similar to RDT 3.0. As a team we decided to use Stop and Wait method with the help of ACKâ€™s, sequence numbers, timers and checksum for reliable transfer. Since we had 3 topologies to work among we decided to use threads to increase program performance, speed and expolit multiple links at the same time.
